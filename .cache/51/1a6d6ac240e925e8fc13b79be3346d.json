In English, Mars \n  carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as \n  the \"Red Planet\".\n\n  Source : Wikipedia <!-- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars -->\n\n  <!-- Overview Content End -->\n\n  <!-- Internal Structure Content Start -->\n\n  Like Earth, Mars has differentiated into a dense metallic core overlaid \n  by less dense materials. Scientists initially determined that the core \n  is at least partially liquid. Current models of its interior imply a \n  core consisting primarily of iron and nickel with about 16–17% sulfur.\n\n  Source : Wikipedia <!-- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars#Internal_structure -->\n\n  <!-- Internal Structure Content End -->\n\n  <!-- Surface Geology Content Start -->\n\n  Mars is a terrestrial planet whose surface consists of minerals containing \n  silicon and oxygen, metals, and other elements that typically make up rock. \n  The surface is primarily composed of tholeiitic basalt, although parts are \n  more silica-rich than typical basalt.\n\n  Source : Wikipedia <!-- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars#Surface_geology -->\n\n  <!-- Surface Geology Content End -->\n\n  01 Overview\n  02 Internal Structure\n  03 Surface Geology\n\n  Rotation Time\n  1.03 Days\n\n  Revolution Time\n  1.88 Years\n\n  Radius\n  3,389.5 KM\n\n  Average Temp.\n  -28°c\n</body>\n</html>"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"e8571c0712b52fa3d5eeadb170a71cd5","cacheData":{}}
