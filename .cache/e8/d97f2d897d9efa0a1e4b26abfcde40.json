In the Solar \n  System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, \n  and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth, more massive than \n  its near-twin Uranus.\n\n  Source : Wikipedia <!-- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune -->\n\n  <!-- Overview Content End -->\n\n  <!-- Internal Structure Content Start -->\n\n  Neptune's internal structure resembles that of Uranus. Its atmosphere forms about 5% \n  to 10% of its mass and extends perhaps 10% to 20% of the way towards the core. \n  Increasing concentrations of methane, ammonia and water are found in the lower regions.\n\n  Source : Wikipedia <!-- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune#Internal_structure -->\n\n  <!-- Internal Structure Content End -->\n\n  <!-- Surface Geology Content Start -->\n\n  Neptune's atmosphere is 80% hydrogen and 19% helium. A trace amount of methane is also \n  present. Prominent absorption bands of methane exist at wavelengths above 600 nm, in \n  the red and infrared portion of the spectrum.\n\n  Source : Wikipedia <!-- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune#Atmosphere -->\n\n  <!-- Surface Geology Content End -->\n\n  01 Overview\n  02 Internal Structure\n  03 Surface Geology\n\n  Rotation Time\n  16.08 Hours\n\n  Revolution Time\n  164.79 Years\n\n  Radius\n  24,622 KM\n\n  Average Temp.\n  -201Â°c\n</body>\n</html>"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"103692b44585369cd7d5fbee95299e9c","cacheData":{}}
