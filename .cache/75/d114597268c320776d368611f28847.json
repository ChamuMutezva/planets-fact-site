It is a gas giant with an average radius of about \n  nine and a half times that of Earth. It only has one-eighth the average \n  density of Earth.\n\n  Source : Wikipedia <!-- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn -->\n\n  <!-- Overview Content End -->\n\n  <!-- Internal Structure Content Start -->\n\n  Despite consisting mostly of hydrogen and helium, most of Saturn's mass \n  is not in the gas phase, because hydrogen becomes a non-ideal liquid \n  when the density is above 0.01 g/cm3, which is reached at a radius \n  containing 99.9% of Saturn's mass.\n\n  Source : Wikipedia <!-- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn#Internal_structure -->\n\n  <!-- Internal Structure Content End -->\n\n  <!-- Surface Geology Content Start -->\n\n  The outer atmosphere of Saturn contains 96.3% molecular hydrogen and 3.25% \n  helium by volume. The planet's most famous feature is its prominent ring \n  system, which is composed mostly of ice particles with a smaller amount \n  of rocky debris and dust. \n\n  Source : Wikipedia <!-- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn#Atmosphere -->\n\n  <!-- Surface Geology Content End -->\n\n  01 Overview\n  02 Internal Structure\n  03 Surface Geology\n\n  Rotation Time\n  10.8 Hours\n\n  Revolution Time\n  29.46 Years\n\n  Radius\n  58,232 KM\n\n  Average Temp.\n  -138Â°c\n</body>\n</html>"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"84fb70401a561e2ec06dd55bc2fbac25","cacheData":{}}
